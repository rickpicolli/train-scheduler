## **Overview**

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates its information with Moment.js. This website provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## **Instructions.**

To play with Train Scheduler, you can visit https://rickpicolli.github.io/train-scheduler/ ! If you prefer to run the application locally, you can clone this repository and open index.html in your web browser of choice.

## **About the application**

Administrators are able to submit the following:
- Train Name
- Destination
- First Train Time -- in military time
- Frequency -- in minutes
- You will get the information about when the next train will arrive.
- Users from many different machines are able to view same trains times.
